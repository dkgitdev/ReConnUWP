### It's not good yet!

... but it gets job done. 

Known issues:
- bad-looking UI;
- it does not remember old removed devices;
- to update device list it must be relaunched;
- if re-pairing is interrupted, device needs to be paired normally.

### Installation

Setup is a little trick, thanks to Microsoft:

1. download *.cer and *.msixbundle from releases tab;
2. duoble click *.cer file;
3. chose to install certificate;
4. chose Local Computer;
5. chose manual location and select "Trusted People" folder;
5. double click *.msixbundle and install it.
